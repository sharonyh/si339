    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      Hi, I’m Sharon! Currently, I’m a third year student at the University of Michigan, majoring in Information and double minoring in Business and Art & Design. 
      I think of myself as a UI/UX designer with a passion for accessible and beautiful designs. Focusing on forming human connections through digital interfaces, 
      I aim to bring joy into people’s everyday lives with my creations.
    </p>

    <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy creative writing, reading the news, listening to podcasts on UI/UX design, and watching Youtube videos about game design. 
        My most recent TV obsession is The Good Place. If you like my work, feel free to send me an email; I’m always open to discussion and new opportunities!
    </p>
