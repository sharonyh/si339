    <h1>Birthday Cards</h1>

    <p>
        Graphic design is my greatest passion. Wanting to practice my skills more, I started designing birthday 
        and Christmas cards for friends starting from summer 2017. Each birthday card is entirely customized to the 
        friend, taking into account their favorite color, indulgences, and idiosyncrasies.
