    <h1>Dough</h1>

    <p>
        During Winter 2019, I joined Infolab: an extracurricular through the School of Information that provides 
        students with semester-long opportunities to act as design consultants for real-world clients. My client that 
        term was Dough — an MBA-founded startup focusing on an effective digital way to tackle the student loan problem 
        rampant in America.

        By conducting UX research and developing both a low and medium-fidelity for their product, I was able to gain 
        valuable, working knowledge of the UI/UX sphere. While I can’t disclose too much of what I did for Dough, feel free 
        to reach out to me if you have any questions!
